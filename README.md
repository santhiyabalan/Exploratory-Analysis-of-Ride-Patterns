# **Exploratory Analysis of Ride Patterns**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to explore and analyze ride-sharing data to uncover key patterns related to ride duration, fare amounts, passenger counts, and ride demand across different days of the week. The insights gained can be useful for optimizing ride-sharing operations, improving customer experience, and informing pricing strategies.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Google Colab**
- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**

## **Data Description**
The dataset used in this project contains 946 ride records with the following columns:
- `ride_id`: Unique identifier for each ride.
- `pickup_time`: Timestamp indicating when the ride was booked.
- `dropoff_time`: Timestamp indicating when the ride was completed.
- `pickup_location`: Location where the ride was initiated.
- `dropoff_location`: Location where the ride ended.
- `pickup_latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the pickup location.
- `pickup_longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the pickup location.
- `dropoff_latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the dropoff location.
- `dropoff_longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the dropoff location.
- `passenger_count`: Number of passengers in the ride.
- `ride_duration`: Duration of the ride in minutes.
- `fare_amount`: Fare charged for the ride.
- `payment_method`: Method used for payment (e.g., Credit Card, Cash).

## **Key Steps**
### **1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- The data was cleaned to handle missing or invalid values.
- A new column, `day_of_week`, was extracted from the `pickup_time` column. This column indicates the day of the week when the ride was initiated, helping to analyze ride frequency across different days.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
The main focus of the analysis was to uncover insights into:
- **Ride Frequency by Day of the Week**: By extracting the **day of the week** from the `pickup_time`, the dataset was analyzed to identify the busiest days.
- **Fare vs. Passenger Count**: A relationship was explored between the number of passengers and the fare charged.
- **Ride Duration by Location**: The average ride duration was calculated for different pickup locations to identify patterns in trip lengths.

### **3. Data Visualizations**
To communicate the findings, several visualizations were created:
- **Bar Chart for Ride Frequency by Day**: A bar chart showing the number of rides per day of the week.
- **Boxplot for Fare vs. Passenger Count**: A boxplot showing the distribution of fares for different passenger counts.
- **Scatterplot for Pickup Location Distribution**: A scatterplot visualizing the geographical spread of pickup locations.

## **Insights and Findings**
- **Peak Ride Days**: The analysis revealed specific days of the week with significantly higher ride demand, which can help with optimizing driver allocation.
- **Fare Trends**: The data showed that rides with more passengers generally have higher fares, indicating a potential relationship between passenger count and fare pricing.
- **Geographical Insights**: Certain pickup locations had higher ride frequencies, which can inform operational decisions for both riders and drivers.

## **Conclusion**
The project provided valuable insights into ride-sharing patterns, and the findings could be used to:
- **Optimize Operations**: By understanding peak days, businesses can optimize driver allocation for more efficient service.
- **Improve Customer Experience**: Knowing the fare trends based on passenger counts can help design pricing strategies.
- **Geographical Planning**: Identifying the most popular pickup locations can help target key areas for improved service.

## **How to Run the Project**
To run the project on your local machine, you will need the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualizations.

Install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

Then, you can run the notebook by opening it in **Google Colab** or any Python environment.

## **Future Work**
- **Adding More Features**: The analysis could be expanded to include factors like ride type (e.g., economy, premium) if such data is available.
- **Time Series Analysis**: A deeper analysis of ride patterns over time (e.g., hourly trends) could be beneficial to understand daily fluctuations in demand.
